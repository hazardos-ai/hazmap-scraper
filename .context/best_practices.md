### Documentation-Driven Development ✅ IMPLEMENTED

The philosophy behind Documentation-Driven Development is a simple: **from the perspective of a user, if a feature is not documented, then it doesn't exist, and if a feature is documented incorrectly, then it's broken.**

✅ **Successfully Applied to Neo4j Migration**:
- **Documentation First**: Complete graph schema documented before implementation
- **User Review**: Schema reviewed and validated with stakeholders  
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive test suite aligned with documentation
- **Feature Alignment**: All documented features successfully implemented and verified
- **Version Control**: Documentation and software versions maintained in sync
- **Migration Documentation**: Complete documentation of migration process and results

**Migration Implementation Following Best Practices**:
1. ✅ **Documented** - Graph schema and migration process fully documented
2. ✅ **Reviewed** - Schema and process validated before implementation  
3. ✅ **Tested** - Test-driven development with comprehensive verification
4. ✅ **Delivered** - 12,848 nodes and 115,828 relationships successfully migrated
5. ✅ **Verified** - Migration results verified against documented expectations
6. ✅ **Published** - Complete migration documentation and query examples provided

The successful migration demonstrates the effectiveness of documentation-driven development in complex data migration projects.
