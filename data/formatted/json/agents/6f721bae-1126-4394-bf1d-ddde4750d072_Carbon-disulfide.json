Elevation of liver function tests has been reported after acute exposure. [LaDou, p. 497-8] It can cause both acute and chronic encephalopathy. Alice Hamilton described in the 1920s two cases, \"one of slowly developing paralysis of the legs, the other of rapidly developing manic-depressive insanity.\" [Hamilton A. Exploring the Dangerous Trades. Beverly, MA: OEM Press, 1995, p. 389] There is limited evidence that CS2 can increase spontaneous abortion in humans and birth defects in animals. There is also evidence that CS2 can decrease sperm counts in experimental animals and reduce libido in exposed workers. [Frazier, p. 171-2] The risk of death from coronary heart disease was increased 2.5 to 5 fold in a studies of viscose rayon workers. [NIOSH Guidelines for Chemical Hazards] Viscous rayon workers suffered retinal hemorrhages and microvascular aneurysms. Optic nerve damage was also seen after heavy acute or chronic exposure. [Sullivan, p. 1209] Vigliani studied over 380 cases in Italy that occurred in the decades prior to 1953. He concluded that chronic exposure to at least 45 ppm was necessary to cause intoxication. [ACGIH] Heavy, chronic exposure to CS2 is associated with kidney disease as a secondary effect from the accelerated atherosclerosis.
