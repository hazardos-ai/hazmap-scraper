        "value": "Enriched uranium is used as fuel in nuclear power plants and submarines. [Sullivan, p.1269] Mineral deposits containing uranium include pitchblende, uraninite, autunite, uranophane, and coffinite. Natural uranium contains over 99% U-238 (T1/2 = 4.47 billion years). Enriched uranium for commercial fuel contains 2-3% U-235 (T1/2 = 700 million years). Higher percentages of U-235 are used in fuel for submarines and in nuclear weapons (usually over 90%). Depleted uranium is less radioactive than natural uranium. It is used by the military for bullets, missiles, and tank armor. [EPA] Uranium ore is produced from underground and open-pit mines. From the ores, uranium mills produce yellowcake, which is a complex mixture containing 80-96% uranium. The yellowcake is used to produce nuclear fuel. [PMID 14691274 ] In the nuclear fuel cycle, yellowcake is converted into uranium hexafluoride gas, which is fed through centrifuges repeatedly to separate isotopes until uranium is enriched. The low-level enriched uranium is used for nuclear fuel while the highly enriched can be used in nuclear weapons. [BBC News] \"The two principal natural isotopes are uranium-235 (0.7 percent of natural uranium), which is fissile, and uranium-238 (99.3 percent of natural uranium), which is fissionable by fast neutrons and is fertile.\" [NRC Glossary]",

[LaDou, p. 422] Acute renal failure in humans has been reported rarely. No chronic renal disease has been documented.
